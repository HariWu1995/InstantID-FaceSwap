  face_image: "Image of face"
  pose_image: "Image of human pose to swap face with 'face_image'"

  mask_strength: "Strength of mask.\nDefault: 0.99"
  mask_padding_W: "Padding into face-mask, in width. \nShould be larger to cover the ears."
  mask_padding_H: "Padding into face-mask, in height."
  mask_threshold: "Threshold to auto-segment face. \nShould be low in hard condition."
